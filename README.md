## Instructions to run
1. Make sure you have MySQL downloaded.
1. Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and set your username in `spring.datasource.username=root` and password in `spring.datasource.password=`
1. Run the main function located in `MovieTheatreSystemApplication.java`.

Running the main function will automatically create the database with default values.

When the Spring Boot application starts, you may run the frontend and start making requests.

Also, you may open the Postman collection `Movie Theatre System.postman_collection.json` to view all of our API endpoints.
