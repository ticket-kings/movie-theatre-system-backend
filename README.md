## Instructions to run
Run the main function located in `MovieTheatreSystemApplication.java`.
This will automatically create the database with default values.

When the Spring Boot application starts, you may run the frontend and start making requests.

Also, you may open the Postman collection `Movie Theatre System.postman_collection.json` to view all of our API endpoints.
